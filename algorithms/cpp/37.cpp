    /** 37. Sudoku Solver
        Backtracking

        Intuition:
            The core idea of the algorithm is very, very simple: exhaustive search. 
            For each empty cell, exhaustively try numbers from 1 to 9. 
                If an illegal number is encountered (one that already exists in the same row, column, or 3Ã—3 area), skip it. 
                If a valid number is found, continue to exhaust the next empty cell.
            
        Algorithm:

        time O(9^(n))
            where n is number of empty cells. In the worst case, with each empty cell, we have maximum 9 options. 
            But since the board only have 1 valid solution, so this time complexity is reduced a lot.
        space O(n)
